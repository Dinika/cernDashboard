What is it?
-----------------

The cernDashboard is a web-based dashboard that helps in visualization of Openstack cloud resources at CERN. I built it as an Openlab Summer Student.

Where can you get it from?
---------------------------
I've made the code public. You can fork/clone it from my GitHub/Gitlab repo. Here are the links:
GitLab
https://:@gitlab.cern.ch:8443/dsaxena/cern-dashboard.git

GitHub

This version
-----------------
I'm still working on the dashboard, as such the code right now is not very polished. It's functional, however. I'm fixing things every week. Right now there's only one branch (the master branch), but I'm soon going to add another which will contain the code for a more responsive dashboard.

Directory Structure
---------------------
You'll find the following directories:
1. htmlDocs - contains the html files. Here's where you'll find index.html which displays the 'homepage' of the dashboard
2. css - contains the external stylesheets. I have to create and add a few more of these files.
3. imgs - contains the images used in the dashboard. The favicon is also present here.
4. js - contain files that have JavaScript code.
5. Samples - contains code for some sample graphs and charts that I created while learning d3.js and dimple. They are only mockups. Feel free to remove them.

Technologies Used
------------------
HTML5
CSS
JavaScript
d3.js
dimple (An API for d3.js)
I'm working on adding Bootstrap to the code. Hopefully, it'll be done soon.
