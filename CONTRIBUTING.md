Here are few issues that you may contribute to. I will separately create issues for each of them, too. Thanks for the help!

Bugs/Issues that need to be fixed
----------------------------------

1. On returning to the normal mode after the fullscreen mode, the two boxes to the right of the screen mess up in size.

2. The z-height of faulty VMs (represented by hot-pink bubbles) needs to be such that they always appear over other VMs (blue/yellow bubbles).   

3. When a new bubble is clicked, some of the information about the bubble that was clicked before it retains in the rectangular box on the right-side of the screen.

4. The code only works for 2 faulty VMs right now. I have to add a loop that goes over all the bubbles to check if they are faulty.

5. The box on the bottom right of the screen needs to have some relevant content. For that matter, even the horizontal navigation bar on the top should have more appropriate tab names.

6. The dashboard is not responsive.

7. This is more of a reminder to myself. I have to add comments in my code.

8. Resolve the JavaScript errors that appear on the console.

9. Change the favicon.

10. Change the Search div into a textBox and the 'Zoom into Faulty VM' div into a button.

11. Add functionality to the search button.

12. Keep one of the three display.js files:
->display.js
->js/display.js
->js/display1.js

I won't be surprised if somebody finds bugs that are not listed above. These are just the ones that I can think of right now.
